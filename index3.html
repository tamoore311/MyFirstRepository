<h1>Tamera Moore</h1>

<p>I am from South Carolina, also known as the "Palmetto State." It has such pretty landscapes with mountains in the Upstate and beaches in the Lowcountry. The seafood on the coast is amazing!  SC is often recognized as the home of shrimp and grits.</p>
  
<p>I chose Berkeley's J-School because it offers a smaller learning environment. I also wanted two years to develop as a journalist. The hands-on nature of learning here at the j-school, particularly for video journalism, is critical for me. Finally, we have so many faculty and lecturers who are so accomplished within their respective fields and it's good to have them as mentors.</p>
